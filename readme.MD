# Deep Learning Projects in C++

Welcome to my deep learning projects repository! Here, you will find three original implementations of neural networks developed from scratch in C++.

## 1. Deep Learning Architecture

**Description:**  
The *Deep Learning Architecture* project allows users to create an interactive neural network architecture by defining the number of neurons in each layer. This hands-on approach enhances understanding of neural network structures and offers insights into how different configurations impact model performance.

**Features:**
- Interactive interface for architecture customization.
- Implementation of various activation functions.
- Ability to train and test the network on simple datasets.

## 2. Supply Chain Deep Learning Model

**Description:**  
This project is a deep learning model developed to address specific challenges in supply chain management. The C++ implementation was created from scratch and can handle complex data, providing predictions that aid strategic decision-making.

**Features:**
- Supervised learning algorithms.
- Focus on optimizing logistics processes.
- Capability to analyze historical data for future predictions.

## 3. Topology-Based Data Classification (Neural Network)

**Description:**  
The neural network in this project classifies data based on their topologies, allowing for an innovative approach to data analysis.

**Features:**
- Classification based on data topology.
- Methods for visualizing and interpreting results.
